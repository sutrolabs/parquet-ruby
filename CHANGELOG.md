# Changelog

## Unreleased
- Add `Parquet.repack` for streaming Parquet files with matching schemas
- `string_cache:` on `Parquet.write_rows` now also accepts an Integer to set the cache
  capacity (`true` uses the default, `false` disables); a non-positive, excessive,
  or non-boolean/non-integer value is rejected. Retention is bounded by entry count,
  per-value byte size, and total cached string bytes. String-cache logs now report
  cache misses instead of mislabeling bounded-cache misses as exact unique strings.
- `string_storage:` on `Parquet.each_row`/`each_column` now also accepts a hash to set the
  process-wide `:shared` leak budget, e.g. `{ mode: :shared, max_entries: 16_384,
  max_value_bytes: 1024 }`; each read enforces that budget for returned zero-copy
  values, and new process-wide leaks also have hard process entry/byte ceilings.
  Values past either bound fall back to frozen copies, and fallback caching is
  bounded by both entry count and retained bytes.
- Unify write batch sizing: the core writer now owns all batching/flushing (the adapter no
  longer keeps a second, separately-tuned batch manager), and `batch_size:`/`flush_threshold:`/
  `sample_size:` are forwarded to it. `flush_threshold` now bounds the writer's in-progress
  (encoded) buffer rather than an estimate of pre-encode row bytes, and its default is 100MB
  (was 64MB). Per-batch debug log lines are no longer emitted.
- Add a `string_storage:` option to `Parquet.each_row`/`each_column` controlling how
  string values become Ruby strings: `:copy` (default, unchanged), `:intern`
  (dedup low-cardinality equal values through a bounded intern cache, then fall
  back to frozen copies), and `:shared` (frozen, zero-copy strings backed by Rust
  memory for short, repeated, low-cardinality values, with a bounded leak that
  falls back to frozen copies).
- Fix `each_row(..., columns: [...], result_type: :hash)` mislabeling values when the
  requested column order differed from the file schema order: projected rows are
  yielded in file order, so hash keys now follow file order too.
- Struct field-name keys are now interned and reused across rows on read, including
  in the default mode.
- Writing a decimal whose unscaled value exceeds the declared precision, or whose
  scale disagrees with the schema, now raises a clear error instead of silently
  storing an out-of-precision value. Negative decimal scales are rejected up front.
- Map keys now default to required (non-nullable) in the schema DSL, matching the
  Parquet spec and what the writer already produced.
- Reading is faster on wide tables: the parquet field lookup is computed once per
  read instead of rescanning per row.
- A fixed-size-binary value of the wrong length is now rejected at `write_row`
  (fail fast) instead of failing later at flush.
- Dynamic and fixed write batch sizes are bounded by total buffered value slots, and
  invalid `batch_size:`/`sample_size:` values are rejected before allocation.
  `write_columns` now rejects row-only sizing/cache options instead of accepting
  inert values, and accepts `logger:` for column-write progress logs.

### New Features & Enhancements

1. **Schema DSL for Complex Data Types**

   - Introduced a **new DSL** (Domain-Specific Language) for defining Parquet schemas in Ruby.
   - You can now describe **structs**, **lists**, and **maps** in a more expressive way:
     ```ruby
      schema = Parquet::Schema.define do
        field :id, :int32, nullable: false
        field :name, :string
        field :age, :int16
        field :weight, :float
        field :active, :boolean
        field :last_seen, :timestamp_millis, nullable: true
        field :scores, :list, item: :int32
        field :details, :struct do
          field :name, :string
          field :score, :double
        end
        field :tags, :list, item: :string
        field :metadata, :map, key: :string, value: :string
        field :properties, :map, key: :string, value: :int32
        field :complex_map, :map, key: :string, value: :struct do
          field :count, :int32
          field :description, :string
        end
        field :nested_lists, :list, item: :list do
          field :item, :string
        end
        field :map_of_lists, :map, key: :string, value: :list do
          field :item, :int32
        end
      end
     ```
   - This DSL supports nested (`struct` within `struct`, `list` of `struct`, etc.) and required/optional fields (`nullable: true`), making it easier to handle complex Parquet schemas.

2. **Writing Maps, Structs, and Lists**

   - The gem now supports **nested data** writes for:
     - **Maps** (`map<keyType, valueType>`), including map of primitives or map of nested types.
     - **Lists** (`list<T>`), including lists of structs or lists of primitives.
     - **Structs** (nested structures), letting you store records that have sub-records.
   - This feature is integrated into both the row-based and column-based writing APIs.
   - Reading these complex types (`each_row`, `each_column`) has been updated as well, so lists and maps yield the expected Ruby arrays and hashes.

3. **Logger Integration**

   - Added support for passing in a **Ruby logger** object for the gem’s internal logging.
   - The gem checks for an optional `logger:` keyword argument in methods and will use it if provided.
   - We'll respect the level returned by `logger.level` otherwise you can also override the log level with the environment variable **`PARQUET_GEM_LOG_LEVEL`** (e.g., `export PARQUET_GEM_LOG_LEVEL=debug`).
   - When no logger is provided, important warnings will print to `stderr`.

4. **Optional Slow Tests in CI**
   - In the GitHub Actions workflow (`ruby.yml`), we now set the environment variable `RUN_SLOW_TESTS=true`.
   - This allows the test suite to include (or skip) certain slow tests. In your local development, you can unset or override this if you want to skip longer-running tests.

### Other Changes

- **Internal Refactoring**:
  - Moved some reading/writing logic into `common.rs` and `logger.rs` for clearer code organization.
  - Introduced a new `RubyLogger` wrapper in Rust for bridging Ruby’s logger with Rust logging methods.
  - Streamlined the enumerator creation code to handle `logger` and `strict` mode more consistently.
  - Improved error-handling wrappers (`MagnusErrorWrapper`) around Rust’s `ParquetError` to raise clearer Ruby exceptions.

### Breaking Changes or Important Notes

- **Non-Null Fields in DSL**: In the new schema DSL, you can mark fields as `nullable: false`. Attempting to write a `nil` value into a non-nullable field will now raise an exception. Previously, the gem did not strictly enforce non-null constraints.
- **Strict UTF-8 Checks**: Writing invalid UTF-8 strings (e.g., corrupted byte sequences) will now raise an `EncodingError` rather than silently truncating or converting them.
- **Complex Nested Fields**: If you attempt to write nested lists/maps/structs but pass incompatible Ruby data (like an array for a map or a simple string instead of a struct-hash), you’ll get a clearer runtime error. The gem enforces that your data matches the declared schema shape.

### Migration Tips

- If you already used the older “legacy” schema format (an array of `{"name" => "type"}` pairs), it will continue to work. However, you can now opt into the **DSL** approach for more nested/complex use cases.

## 0.4.2

- When no schema is provided. Default to `f0`, `f1`, `f2`, etc.
- Improve string conversion when writing parquet.
- Improve error message when writing columns with a bad payload.

## 0.4.1

- Add validations that seekable IO objects are actually seekable.

## 0.4.0

- Default to strict parsing of strings
- Instead of returning strings from the reader in `ASCII-8BIT` format when `strict: false` (the default prior to this change), we now return the string encoded as lossy UTF-8.

## 0.3.3

- Re-add seek-able IO optimizations.

## 0.3.2

- Determining whether we've received a StringIO is difficult to do safely, so just treat it like an IO.

## 0.3.1

- Start estimating batch size before we have filled the sampling buffer to prevent OOMs on huge rows.

## 0.3.0

Got rid of surprising behaviour that bypassed ruby if the provided IO had a file descriptor. It led to confusing bugs where people would write a custom read method that was ignored because we read the file descriptor directly.

## 0.2.13

- Improvements to error handling throughout the library
- Improvements to the header cache used when reading in `:hash` mode
- Optional UTF-8 validation when reading strings with `strict: true`

## 0.2.9

- Added `sample_size` option to `write_rows` for customizing row size estimation:
  - Controls how many rows are sampled to estimate optimal batch sizes
  - Defaults to 100 rows if not specified
  - Example: `Parquet.write_rows(data, schema: schema, write_to: path, sample_size: 200)`

## 0.2.8

- Added support for writing Parquet files with compression:
  - Supports common compression codecs: gzip, snappy, lz4, zstd
  - Configurable via `compression` option when writing files
  - Example: `Parquet.write_rows(data, schema: schema, write_to: path, compression: "gzip")`
  - Default is uncompressed if no compression specified

## 0.2.7

- Added support for specifying `format` in schema for parsing time strings in the iterators when writing to Parquet
  - Allows parsing date strings with `format` option in schema (e.g. `"%Y-%m-%d"` for dates)
  - Allows parsing timestamp strings with `format` option in schema (e.g. `"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S%z"` for timestamps)
  - Works with both `write_rows` and `write_columns` methods

## 0.2.6

- Fix handling of explicit `nil` for optional arguments

## 0.2.5

- Arbitrarily bumping the verison a bit imply that the gem isn't alpha quality.
- Add support for writing all types except for structs and arrays

## 0.0.5

- Remove unused rust dependencies

## 0.0.4

- Fix the "Homepage" field in the gemspec

## 0.0.3

- Added `each_column` method for efficient column-oriented reading of Parquet files
  - Reads data in batches for better performance compared to row-wise iteration
  - Supports both hash and array output formats via `result_type` option
  - Accepts optional `columns` parameter to read only specific columns
  - Configurable `batch_size` parameter to control memory usage
  - Works with file paths and IO objects
  - Returns Enumerator when no block given
  - Handles complex types like arrays, maps, and nested structs
  - Preserves type information for numeric, date, and timestamp columns

## 0.0.2

- Added `columns` option to `each_row` method. Allows us to take advantage of the column projection feature of the parquet crate.
- General refactoring to improve readability and maintainability.

## 0.0.1

Initial release.

Supports reading each row as a hash or an array from a file or an IO object.
